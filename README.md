# Wordle
A simple Worlde game that runs on C#
The game randomly picks between 30 different words and asks the player to type an answer
If the answer has 5 or more characters, it will compare them
If it has less, it just skips the answer and removes 1 life
If the letters are in the correct location, they will be highlighted in green
If they aren't, but exist in the word, they will be highlighted in yellow
Otherwise, they will be highlighted in red
If the player fails 6 times, they loose
If they guess correctly, they win
Once either happens, the game closes.
